# n-difference

If i is an odd number then i/2 and i/2-1 are its numbers(for as long as they aren't fractions, it requires another situation described below). Then n = j - 1 is its difference if j is a number which those 2 numbers are multiplyed by. To prove this we can subtract those numbers like this: n = ((i/2)*j + (i/2-1)) - ((i/2-1)*j + (i/2)). Also, if j > 1, then n>0, if j = 1, n = 0 and if j < 1, then n < 0. However, the numbers when i is even or a fraction are: i/2. E.g. 7 is i, (4,3) are its numbers(i/2, i/2-1), then if j = 2, n = 1 or n = (4 * 2 + 3) - (3 * 2 + 4), if j = 1, then n = 0, or n = (4*1 + 3) - (3*1 + 4), if j = 0, then n = -1 or |1|, or n = (0 + 3) - (0 + 4). If i = 8, then i/2 = 4 or both numbers are equal no matter what. If i = 3.5 or its numbers are fractions, then both numbers are i/2 or equal. This rule holds for all numbers i which are odd. In other words if i is odd and it's an integer, then this rule applies and i/2 and i/2-1 are both its numbers, if it's real or rational, then this rule no longer applies and i/2 are both its numbers.
